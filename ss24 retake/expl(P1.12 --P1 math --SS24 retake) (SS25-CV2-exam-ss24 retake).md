Looking at the given information:
- Matrix A ∈ ℝⁿˣᵐ (n rows, m columns)
- rank(A) = m ≤ n

Yes, this matrix is full rank.

A matrix is considered "full rank" when its rank equals the smaller of its two dimensions. For an n×m matrix:
- If n ≤ m, full rank means rank = n (full row rank)
- If m ≤ n, full rank means rank = m (full column rank)

Since we're told that rank(A) = m and m ≤ n, the matrix has full column rank, which means it is indeed full rank. This indicates that all m columns of the matrix are linearly independent.

Looking at this optimization problem, I need to find x that minimizes ||Ax|| subject to ||x|| = 1, where A has rank m ≤ n.

Since we want to minimize ||Ax|| subject to the constraint ||x|| = 1, this is equivalent to finding the vector x in the null space of A (or closest to it if A has full rank).

Let me analyze each option using the SVD decomposition A = UDV^T:

For any vector x, we have: ||Ax||² = ||UDV^T x||² = ||DV^T x||²

Since U is orthogonal, it preserves norms. So I need to minimize ||DV^T x|| subject to ||x|| = 1.

Let y = V^T x. Since V is orthogonal, ||y|| = ||x|| = 1, so I need to minimize ||Dy|| subject to ||y|| = 1.

Since D is diagonal with singular values σ₁ ≥ σ₂ ≥ ... ≥ σₘ ≥ 0, and assuming rank(A) = m means σₘ > 0, the matrix D looks like:

D = [σ₁ 0 ... 0 0 ... 0] [0 σ₂ ... 0 0 ... 0] [⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮] [0 0 ... σₘ 0 ... 0]

For y = [y₁, y₂, ..., yₙ]^T, we have: ||Dy||² = σ₁²y₁² + σ₂²y₂² + ... + σₘ²yₘ²

To minimize this subject to ||y|| = 1, I should put all weight on the component with the smallest singular value. Since σₘ is the smallest (last) singular value, the optimal y is: y = [0, 0, ..., 0, 1, 0, ..., 0]^T (1 in the m-th position)

Since x = Vy and V = [v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ], we have: x = v₁·0 + v₂·0 + ... + vₘ·1 + ... + vₙ·0 = vₘ

Therefore, x is the m-th column of V, which corresponds to the smallest singular value.

Looking at the options:

- The last row of U: No, this relates to the output space
- The first column of U: No, this corresponds to the largest singular value
- The last row of V: No, this would be a row, not a column
- **The last column of V**: This corresponds to the smallest singular value σₘ

Wait, let me reconsider. If the singular values are ordered σ₁ ≥ σ₂ ≥ ... ≥ σₘ, then the smallest is σₘ, which corresponds to the m-th column of V. But the problem states "the last singular value of D is the smallest," which could mean the rightmost column in the ordering.

Given the context and standard conventions, the answer is **the last column of V**, which corresponds to the smallest singular value.

The correct answer is: **x is the last column of V, where A = UDV^T is the singular value decomposition of A.**
