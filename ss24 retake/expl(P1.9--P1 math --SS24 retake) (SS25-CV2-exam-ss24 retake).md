Ah, you're asking for an intuitive way to **derive** the relationship $\mu = 1 - \lambda$ directly, not just interpret it! Here’s how to "see" it without formal proof:

### Intuitive Derivation (Step-by-Step)

1. **Start with the Eigenvector Insight**:
   - An eigenvector $\mathbf{v}$ of $A$ is a special direction where $A$ acts like scalar multiplication: $A\mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}$.
   - Intuitively, $\mathbf{v}$ is a direction where $A$ just stretches/shrinks $\mathbf{v}$ by $\lambda$.

2. **Apply $M = I - A$ to $\mathbf{v}$**:
   - $M\mathbf{v} = (I - A)\mathbf{v} = I\mathbf{v} - A\mathbf{v}$.
   - But $I\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}$ (identity does nothing), and $A\mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}$.
   - So: $M\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v} - \lambda \mathbf{v} = (1 - \lambda)\mathbf{v}$.

3. **Key Realization**:
   - The same $\mathbf{v}$ that was stretched by $\lambda$ under $A$ is now stretched by $(1 - \lambda)$ under $M$.
   - No need for heavy algebra—just recognize that $M$ is a "shifted version" of $A$ applied to $\mathbf{v}$.

4. **Why Eigenvectors Stay the Same**:
   - $M$ is a linear combination of $I$ and $A$, and $A$ doesn’t "rotate" $\mathbf{v}$ (by definition of eigenvectors). So $M$ preserves the eigenvector directions.

### Analogy to Numbers
Think of $A$ as a function that scales inputs by $\lambda$. Then $M = I - A$ is like:
- Taking an input ($\mathbf{v}$), 
- Leaving it unchanged ($I$), 
- Then subtracting the scaled version ($-A$).  
The net effect is scaling by $(1 - \lambda)$.

---

### Why This Makes Sense
- If $\lambda = 0.5$, then $M$ scales $\mathbf{v}$ by $0.5$ (half removed).  
- If $\lambda = 1$, $M$ nullifies $\mathbf{v}$ ($\mu = 0$).  
- If $\lambda = 2$, $M$ inverts and scales $\mathbf{v}$ ($\mu = -1$).  

The proof isn’t just symbolic—it’s a direct consequence of how linear combinations interact with eigenvectors. No need for determinants or characteristic polynomials here!

# Eigenvalue Analysis: Matrix A and M = I - A

## Problem Statement

Given a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ with eigenvalues $\lambda > 0$, we need to analyze the eigenvalues of $M \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ where $A = \mathbb{I} - M$ (equivalently, $M = \mathbb{I} - A$).

## General Relationship Between Eigenvalues

### Fundamental Relationship

If $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of matrix $A$, then the corresponding eigenvalue of $M = \mathbb{I} - A$ is:

$$\mu = 1 - \lambda$$

### Proof

Let $\mathbf{v}$ be an eigenvector of $A$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$:
$$A\mathbf{v} = \lambda\mathbf{v}$$

For matrix $M = \mathbb{I} - A$:
$$M\mathbf{v} = (\mathbb{I} - A)\mathbf{v} = \mathbb{I}\mathbf{v} - A\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v} - \lambda\mathbf{v} = (1 - \lambda)\mathbf{v}$$

Therefore, $\mathbf{v}$ is also an eigenvector of $M$ with eigenvalue $\mu = 1 - \lambda$.

## Eigenvalue Properties

### Given Constraints
- All eigenvalues of $A$ satisfy $\lambda > 0$
- Therefore, all eigenvalues of $M$ satisfy $\mu = 1 - \lambda < 1$

### Bounds for Eigenvalues of M

Since $\lambda > 0$ for all eigenvalues of $A$:

**Upper Bound:**
$$\mu = 1 - \lambda < 1$$

**Lower Bound:**
The lower bound depends on the largest eigenvalue of $A$. If $\lambda_{\max}$ is the largest eigenvalue of $A$, then:
$$\mu_{\min} = 1 - \lambda_{\max}$$

### Special Cases

1. **If $A$ has eigenvalues $0 < \lambda < 1$:**
   - Then $M$ has eigenvalues $0 < \mu < 1$

2. **If $A$ has eigenvalues $\lambda > 1$:**
   - Then $M$ has corresponding eigenvalues $\mu < 0$

3. **If $A$ has eigenvalue $\lambda = 1$:**
   - Then $M$ has eigenvalue $\mu = 0$

## Summary

For matrices $A$ and $M = \mathbb{I} - A$:

- **Eigenvalue relationship:** $\mu_i = 1 - \lambda_i$
- **Eigenvectors:** Identical for both matrices
- **Bounds for $M$:** $\mu < 1$ (strict upper bound)
- **Lower bound:** Depends on $\max(\lambda_i)$ of matrix $A$

The transformation $M = \mathbb{I} - A$ represents a reflection of eigenvalues about the point $\frac{1}{2}$ on the real number line.

Here's an intuitive explanation of the relationship between the eigenvalues of $A$ and $M = I - A$:

### Visual Intuition
Imagine the eigenvalues of $A$ as points on a number line (all positive, since $\lambda > 0$). The operation $M = I - A$ essentially:
1. **Flips** these points across the value 0.5 (since $1 - \lambda$ is equivalent to reflecting $\lambda$ about 0.5)
2. **Shifts** them such that:
   - Eigenvalues $\lambda < 1$ become $0 < \mu < 1$ (staying positive but smaller)
   - $\lambda = 1$ becomes $\mu = 0$ (neutral point)
   - $\lambda > 1$ becomes $\mu < 0$ (crossing into negative territory)

### Practical Interpretation
- If $A$ represents a system where its eigenvalues $\lambda$ indicate "strength" or "scaling" (e.g., in linear transformations), then $M$ represents the "complementary weakness" or "residual" after subtracting $A$ from the identity.
- The closer $\lambda$ is to 0, the closer $\mu$ is to 1 (minimal subtraction effect).
- The larger $\lambda$ is, the more negative $\mu$ becomes (overshooting the subtraction).

### Key Takeaways
1. **Mirror Effect**: The eigenvalues of $M$ are a mirrored version of $A$'s eigenvalues around 0.5.
2. **Sign Change Threshold**: $\lambda = 1$ is the critical point where $\mu$ changes from positive to negative.
3. **Eigenvectors Unchanged**: The directions (eigenvectors) stay the same; only the scaling factors (eigenvalues) transform.

This explains why, for example, iterative methods using $M$ might converge if $\lambda_{\text{max}}(A) < 2$ (so $\mu_{\text{min}} > -1$), ensuring stability.
