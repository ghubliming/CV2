Looking at the aperture problem statement you've provided, I can see there are some issues with the options given. Let me clarify what the aperture problem actually is and evaluate these statements:

The **aperture problem** is a fundamental limitation in motion estimation from image sequences. It occurs when trying to determine the motion of a visual pattern through a small aperture (or locally within an image).

Let me analyze each statement:

1. **"the geometry of a scene can only be calculated, if images with different projection centres are available (i.e. camera translation)"**
   - This describes stereo vision or structure from motion, not the aperture problem specifically.

2. **"if the gradient is not zero, the optical flow can be determined by the image gradient at one point"**
   - This is incorrect. Even with a non-zero gradient, you cannot determine the complete optical flow from a single point due to the aperture problem.

3. **"locally, only optical flow orthogonal to the image gradient can be determined"**
   - This is **incorrect as stated**. Actually, only the component of optical flow **parallel** (normal) to the image gradient can be determined locally, not orthogonal to it.

4. **"neighboring pixels have the same motion"**
   - This describes a smoothness assumption used in optical flow algorithms, not the aperture problem itself.

The **correct statement** about the aperture problem should be: **locally, only the component of optical flow normal to edges (parallel to the image gradient) can be reliably determined, while the component tangent to edges (orthogonal to the gradient) remains ambiguous.**

None of the given options correctly describes the aperture problem. If you must choose from these options, there might be an error in the problem statement, particularly in option 3 which has the relationship backwards.

You're thinking of a different concept! The aperture problem and stereo depth estimation are two separate issues in computer vision.

**The Aperture Problem** is specifically about **motion estimation** (optical flow), not depth estimation. It occurs when you're trying to determine how objects are moving in a video sequence. Through a small "aperture" (local window), you can only see part of a moving edge, making it impossible to determine the true direction of motion - you can only detect the component of motion perpendicular to the edge.

**Stereo Depth Estimation** (which option A describes) is about calculating 3D geometry and depth from two cameras with different positions. This is indeed a fundamental requirement - you need at least two viewpoints to triangulate depth through stereo vision.

These are two different problems:
- **Aperture Problem**: Motion estimation limitation in temporal sequences
- **Stereo Problem**: Depth estimation requirement for multiple viewpoints

For the aperture problem specifically, the closest (though still incorrect) answer would be option 3, but it has the relationship backwards. The aperture problem states that locally, only the component of optical flow **normal to edges** (parallel to the gradient) can be determined, not orthogonal to it.

So option A describes stereo vision requirements, not the aperture problem. The question seems to be specifically asking about the aperture problem based on the title.
