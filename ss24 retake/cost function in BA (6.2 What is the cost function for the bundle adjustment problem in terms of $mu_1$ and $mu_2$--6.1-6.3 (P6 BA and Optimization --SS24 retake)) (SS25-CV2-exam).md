Yes, based on the notes in your vault, you are indeed learning about the cost function used in Bundle Adjustment (BA) in computer vision. Here's a detailed breakdown from your notes:

### Key Points About Bundle Adjustment's Cost Function:

1. **Least Squares Formulation** (from [[Why we define the function as SQUARE (SS25-CV2-7)]]):
   - BA minimizes the sum of squared reprojection errors:
     ```math
     \min \sum ||x_{ij} - P(X_j, C_i)||^2
     ```
     where:
     - $x_{ij}$ = observed 2D image point
     - $P(X_j, C_i)$ = projected 3D point $X_j$ using camera parameters $C_i$

2. **Why Squared Errors?**:
   - Gaussian noise assumption for camera measurements
   - Creates smooth, differentiable cost functions
   - Works efficiently with iterative solvers (Gauss-Newton, Levenberg-Marquardt)

3. **Connection to Optimization Methods** (from [[non linear Optimization for BA (SS25-CV2)]]):
   - The cost function is optimized using:
     - **Gauss-Newton**: Approximates Hessian as $J^T J$
     - **Levenberg-Marquardt**: Adds damping term for stability
     - (Compared to slower Gradient Descent or expensive Newton's Method)

4. **Practical Foundations** (from [[What we can learn from Ex 8(SS25-CV2-7)]]):
   - The Jacobian computation skills (e.g., for pose changes) directly apply to BA
   - Teaches how to compute derivatives of reprojection errors w.r.t. camera poses and 3D points
   - Multi-scale and robust estimation techniques extend to BA pipelines

### Why This Matters:
The cost function isn't arbitraryâ€”it reflects:
- Statistical assumptions (Gaussian noise)
- Computational needs (differentiability for optimization)
- Geometric constraints (reprojection errors)

Your notes emphasize that this foundation is critical for implementing real systems like SLAM or SfM, where BA is the "gold standard" for refinement. The squared formulation provides a balance between theoretical correctness (under Gaussian noise) and practical optimization performance.
