Let’s solve the problem step by step.

### 6.1 What are the expected values $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$ for $P(\hat{x}_1 | X_j) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_1, \Sigma_1)$ and $P(\hat{x}_2 | R, T, X_j) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_2, \Sigma_2)$ to model the noise in the observed 2D locations?

- $P(\hat{x}_1 | X_j) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_1, \Sigma_1)$ represents the probability density of the observed 2D point $\hat{x}_1$ given the 3D point $X_j$, modeled as a Gaussian with mean $\mu_1$ and covariance $\Sigma_1$. The mean $\mu_1$ is the expected value of $\hat{x}_1$, which corresponds to the projection $\pi(X_j)$ of the 3D point $X_j$ onto the 2D plane, assuming no noise. Thus, $\mu_1 = \pi(X_j)$.
- $P(\hat{x}_2 | R, T, X_j) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_2, \Sigma_2)$ represents the probability density of the observed 2D point $\hat{x}_2$ given the camera transformation $(R, T)$ and 3D point $X_j$, modeled as a Gaussian with mean $\mu_2$ and covariance $\Sigma_2$. The mean $\mu_2$ is the expected value of $\hat{x}_2$, which is the projection of the transformed 3D point $R X_j + T$ onto the 2D plane. Thus, $\mu_2 = \pi(R X_j + T)$.

**Answer:** $\mu_1 = \pi(X_j)$, $\mu_2 = \pi(R X_j + T)$.

For 6.1, using $x_j$ instead of $\pi(X_j)$ for $\mu_1$ is not appropriate unless $x_j$ is specifically defined as the projected 2D coordinates of the 3D point $X_j$ under the projection function $\pi$. Let’s clarify:

- The problem defines $\pi: \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ as the projection function mapping 3D points $X_j$ to 2D coordinates. The expected value $\mu_1$ for $P(\hat{x}_1 | X_j) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_1, \Sigma_1)$ represents the noiseless projection of $X_j$ onto the 2D plane, which is $\pi(X_j)$.
- If $x_j$ is intended to represent the 2D projection $\pi(X_j)$ (e.g., as a notation choice in your context), then you could use $x_j$ instead, provided it’s consistent. However, the problem’s notation uses $\hat{x}_1$ and $\hat{x}_2$ for observed 2D points and $\pi$ for the projection, suggesting $x_j$ (if used) might refer to something else, like the 3D point itself or a different variable.

To be precise and align with the problem statement, you should use $\mu_1 = \pi(X_j)$. Substituting $x_j$ for $\pi(X_j)$ is only valid if $x_j$ is explicitly defined as the projected 2D point. Without that definition, using $x_j$ could introduce ambiguity or error.

**Answer:** No, you should use $\pi(X_j)$ unless $x_j$ is explicitly defined as $\pi(X_j)$ in your context.

### 6.2 What is the cost function for the bundle adjustment problem in terms of $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$?

[[cost function in BA (6.2 What is the cost function for the bundle adjustment problem in terms of $mu_1$ and $mu_2$--6.1-6.3 (P6 BA and Optimization --SS24 retake)) (SS25-CV2-exam)]]

Let’s solve 6.2 again, incorporating the prior knowledge from your notes about the bundle adjustment (BA) cost function.

#### Context from the Problem:
- The problem involves maximizing $\prod_{j=1}^N P(\hat{x}_1 | X_j) P(\hat{x}_2 | R, T, X_j)$, where $P(\hat{x}_1 | X_j) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_1, \Sigma_1)$ and $P(\hat{x}_2 | R, T, X_j) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_2, \Sigma_2)$.
- $\mu_1 = \pi(X_j)$ and $\mu_2 = \pi(R X_j + T)$ are the expected (noiseless) 2D projections, as determined in 6.1.
- The summation over $N$ points is hinted in equation (6.2).

#### Insights from Your Notes:
- The BA cost function is based on minimizing the sum of squared reprojection errors: $\min \sum ||x_{ij} - P(X_j, C_i)||^2$, where $x_{ij}$ is the observed 2D point and $P(X_j, C_i)$ is the projected 3D point using camera parameters $C_i$.
- Under the Gaussian noise assumption, the negative log-likelihood of the Gaussian distributions leads to a least-squares formulation, which aligns with the squared error approach.
- The cost function should account for the covariance matrices $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ to weight the errors appropriately, reflecting the noise model.

#### Derivation:
- Since $P(\hat{x}_1 | X_j) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_1, \Sigma_1)$ and $P(\hat{x}_2 | R, T, X_j) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_2, \Sigma_2)$, the log-likelihood involves the Mahalanobis distance. The negative log-likelihood (to be minimized) for each point is proportional to:
  - $(\hat{x}_1 - \mu_1)^T \Sigma_1^{-1} (\hat{x}_1 - \mu_1)$ for the first view.
  - $(\hat{x}_2 - \mu_2)^T \Sigma_2^{-1} (\hat{x}_2 - \mu_2)$ for the second view.
- Summing over all $N$ points, as indicated by equation (6.2), the total cost function becomes:
  $$
  \text{Cost} = \sum_{j=1}^N \left[ (\hat{x}_1 - \mu_1)^T \Sigma_1^{-1} (\hat{x}_1 - \mu_1) + (\hat{x}_2 - \mu_2)^T \Sigma_2^{-1} (\hat{x}_2 - \mu_2) \right]
$$
- Substituting $\mu_1 = \pi(X_j)$ and $\mu_2 = \pi(R X_j + T)$, and noting that $\hat{x}_1$ and $\hat{x}_2$ are the observed 2D points (analogous to $x_{ij}$ in your notes), the cost function is:
  $$
  \text{Cost} = \sum_{j=1}^N \left[ (\hat{x}_1 - \pi(X_j))^T \Sigma_1^{-1} (\hat{x}_1 - \pi(X_j)) + (\hat{x}_2 - \pi(R X_j + T))^T \Sigma_2^{-1} (\hat{x}_2 - \pi(R X_j + T)) \right]
$$

#### Alignment with Notes:
- This formulation matches the least-squares approach from your notes ($\min \sum ||x_{ij} - P(X_j, C_i)||^2$), where $P(X_j, C_i)$ corresponds to $\pi(X_j)$ or $\pi(R X_j + T)$, and the inclusion of $\Sigma^{-1}$ accounts for the Gaussian noise assumption and weighting by covariance, enhancing the optimization’s robustness.
- The use of squared errors ensures differentiability, making it suitable for iterative solvers like Gauss-Newton or Levenberg-Marquardt, as noted.

**Answer:** The cost function is $\sum_{j=1}^N \left[ (\hat{x}_1 - \pi(X_j))^T \Sigma_1^{-1} (\hat{x}_1 - \pi(X_j)) + (\hat{x}_2 - \pi(R X_j + T))^T \Sigma_2^{-1} (\hat{x}_2 - \pi(R X_j + T)) \right]$.

### 6.3 Is solving (6.1) in general equivalent to minimizing the bundle adjustment cost function? If not, when is it equivalent?

- Equation (6.1) involves maximizing the product $\prod_{j=1}^N P(\hat{x}_1 | X_j) P(\hat{x}_2 | R, T, X_j)$, where $P$ are probability density functions modeled as Gaussians.
- Maximizing the product of Gaussian likelihoods is equivalent to minimizing the negative log-likelihood, which leads to the cost function derived in 6.2 (up to a constant).
- However, this equivalence holds only if the noise models are Gaussian and the covariances $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ are known and positive definite. If the noise distributions are non-Gaussian or the covariances are not well-defined, the maximization of (6.1) may not correspond to minimizing the standard bundle adjustment cost function.
- Additionally, the problem assumes the projection function $\pi$ and the camera parameters $(R, T)$ are correctly modeled. Any nonlinearity or approximation in $\pi$ could affect the equivalence.

**Answer:** Solving (6.1) is equivalent to minimizing the bundle adjustment cost function when the noise is Gaussian with known, positive definite covariances $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$, and the projection function $\pi$ is accurately modeled. Otherwise, it is not equivalent.
