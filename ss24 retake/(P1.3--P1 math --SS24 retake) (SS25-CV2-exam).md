The Lie algebra **so(n)** is the Lie algebra of the special orthogonal group **SO(n)**, which consists of all **n × n** real matrices that are orthogonal (i.e., $A^T A = I$) with determinant 1. The Lie algebra **so(n)** is the set of all **n × n** real skew-symmetric matrices, equipped with the Lie bracket defined as the matrix commutator.

Formally:

- **Definition**: The Lie algebra **so(n)** consists of all **n × n** real matrices $X$ such that $X^T = -X$, i.e., skew-symmetric matrices.
- **Lie bracket**: For any $X, Y \in \text{so}(n)$, the Lie bracket is given by $[X, Y] = XY - YX$, where $XY$ and $YX$ are standard matrix products.
- **Dimension**: The dimension of **so(n)** is the number of independent entries in a skew-symmetric **n × n** matrix, which is $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.

### Explanation:
- **Skew-symmetric condition**: A matrix $X \in \text{so}(n)$ satisfies $X^T = -X$. This means the diagonal entries are zero ($X_{ii} = 0$), and the off-diagonal entries satisfy $X_{ij} = -X_{ji}$.
- **Relation to SO(n)**: The Lie algebra **so(n)** is the tangent space to the identity of the Lie group **SO(n)**. Any matrix in **so(n)** generates a one-parameter subgroup of rotations in **SO(n)** via the exponential map, $\exp(tX) \in \text{SO}(n)$.
- **Examples**:
  - For **so(2)**: These are 2 × 2 skew-symmetric matrices of the form $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & a \\ -a & 0 \end{pmatrix}$, with dimension 1.
  - For **so(3)**: These are 3 × 3 skew-symmetric matrices, with dimension 3, often associated with the cross-product in $\mathbb{R}^3$. A basis can be given by matrices corresponding to rotations about the x, y, and z axes.

This structure captures the infinitesimal rotations in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and the Lie bracket encodes the non-commutativity of rotations.

# Alternative 

Yes, you can say that the Lie algebra $\text{so}(n)$ is the "logarithm" or "derivative" of the Lie group $\text{SO}(n)$ in the following precise sense:

1. **Tangent space at identity**: $\text{so}(n)$ is the tangent space to $\text{SO}(n)$ at the identity matrix $I$, capturing infinitesimal rotations. This is analogous to how a derivative captures infinitesimal changes.

2. **Exponential map**: The Lie algebra elements $X \in \text{so}(n)$ generate rotations via the exponential map $\exp(tX) \in \text{SO}(n)$. This is analogous to exponentiation being the inverse of taking a logarithm.

3. **Skew-symmetry condition**: The condition $X^T = -X$ for $\text{so}(n)$ arises naturally as the derivative of the orthogonality condition $A^T A = I$ for $\text{SO}(n)$ at $A = I$.

So while "logarithm" and "derivative" are informal analogies, they correctly reflect the mathematical relationship:
- $\text{so}(n) = \text{Lie}(\text{SO}(n))$ (the Lie algebra of $\text{SO}(n)$)
- $\text{SO}(n) = \exp(\text{so}(n))$ (via the exponential map).

The note [[(P1.3--P1 math --SS24 retake) (SS25-CV2-exam)]] explicitly confirms this by stating that $\text{so}(n)$ is the Lie algebra of $\text{SO}(n)$ and describes the exponential map relationship.
