Based on the note [[expl (P1.5--P1 math --SS24 retake) (SS25-CV2-exam)]], here's the answer to your question:

1. **What "dim" means**:  
   In this context, "dim" refers to the **dimension of a Lie algebra**, which represents the number of independent parameters (or degrees of freedom) needed to describe all matrices in that algebra. It's analogous to the number of "knobs" you can adjust to generate any matrix in the set.

2. **Is dim the same as degrees of freedom?**  
   Yes, in this case, the dimension (`dim`) of the Lie algebra corresponds to its **degrees of freedom**. For example:
   - $\mathfrak{so}(2)$ has 1 degree of freedom (rotation angle).  
   - $\mathfrak{se}(2)$ has 3 degrees of freedom (1 for rotation + 2 for translation in $x$ and $y$ directions).

### Key Takeaways:
- $\dim(\mathfrak{so}(2)) = 1$ (only rotation in 2D).  
- $\dim(\mathfrak{se}(2)) = 3$ (rotation + 2D translation).  

The note provides a detailed derivation of these values by analyzing the matrix structures and constraints. Let me know if you'd like further clarification!
