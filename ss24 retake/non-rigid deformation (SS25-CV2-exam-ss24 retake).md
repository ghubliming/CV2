Of course. Here are some examples of "not assumed - allows for non-rigid deformation":

### In the real world:

* **A bouncing ball:** When a rubber ball hits a hard surface, it deforms upon impact, flattening and then regaining its shape. This is a classic example of non-rigid deformation.
* **A beating heart:** The heart muscle constantly changes its shape as it pumps blood throughout the body. This continuous, complex deformation is essential for its function.
* **Facial expressions:** When you smile, frown, or show any emotion, your facial muscles contract and relax, causing the skin to stretch and move in a non-rigid way.
* **A piece of cloth waving in the wind:** A flag or a piece of fabric doesn't have a fixed shape; it bends, folds, and ripples in response to the air currents.

### In computer graphics and animation:

* **Character animation:** Animators use non-rigid deformation to create realistic movements for characters. This includes everything from the subtle jiggle of a character's belly as they walk to the way their clothes wrinkle and move with their body.
* **"Jelly-like" effects:** Think of a cartoon character squashing and stretching as it moves or gets hit. This exaggerated non-rigid deformation is a common animation technique to add humor and dynamism.
* **Simulating soft bodies:** In video games and simulations, objects like pillows, cushions, or even water are modeled using non-rigid deformation to make them react realistically to forces.

### In medical imaging and analysis:

* **Image registration:** When comparing two medical scans of the same patient taken at different times (e.g., before and after treatment), doctors use non-rigid deformation algorithms. These algorithms can account for changes in the patient's position or the deformation of organs between scans, allowing for a more accurate comparison.
* **Tracking organ motion:** During surgery or radiation therapy, it's crucial to track the movement of organs, which can deform due to breathing or other bodily functions. Non-rigid deformation models help to accurately map these changes in real-time.
