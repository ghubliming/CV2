Let’s solve the optimization problems for Questions 6.5 and 6.6 step by step based on the provided problem statement.

### 6.5 Now, let us rewrite the optimality condition for the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm:

The optimality condition for the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is given by the normal equation derived from the nonlinear least squares problem. The problem states:

- The vector $x = \begin{pmatrix} x_p \\ x_i \end{pmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{p+i}$ contains all unknowns, where $x_p \in \mathbb{R}^p$ represents camera poses and $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^i$ represents 3D points.
- The residual vector $r \in \mathbb{R}^n$ captures all reprojection errors for all correspondences.
- The nonlinear least squares problem is:
  $$
  \min_x \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=1}^n r_j(x)^2
$$

For the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, the update step involves solving a damped normal equation:
$$
\left( J^T J + \lambda I \right) \Delta x = -J^T r
$$
where $J$ is the Jacobian matrix of $r$ with respect to $x$, $\lambda$ is the damping factor, and $\Delta x$ is the update to $x$.

The problem provides the system in block form:
$$
\begin{pmatrix} b_p \\ b_i \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} U & W \\ W^T & V \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \Delta x_p \\ \Delta x_i \end{pmatrix}
$$

- $U$ is a block of the matrix with a diagonal structure.
- $V$ is a block with a diagonal structure.
- $W$ is a block that usually does not have a diagonal structure.

#### Explanation:
- $U$ and $V$ have diagonal structures because the camera poses ($x_p$) and 3D points ($x_i$) are typically parameterized such that their contributions to the Hessian approximation $J^T J$ (i.e., $U$ and $V$) are block-diagonal when considering independent parameters or sparse interactions. For example, the reprojection error for a 3D point depends primarily on its own coordinates and the associated camera pose, leading to diagonal or block-diagonal terms.
- $W$ lacks a diagonal structure because it represents the coupling between camera poses and 3D points, where changes in one affect the other through reprojection errors, introducing off-diagonal terms.

**Answer for 6.5:**
- The matrix $(U, V, W)$ has $U$ and $V$ with a diagonal structure due to the independent parameterization of camera poses and 3D points, while $W$ does not have a diagonal structure because it captures the interdependence between poses and points in the reprojection errors.

### 6.6 We build the Schur complement of the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} U & W \\ W^T & V \end{pmatrix}$ as

$$
S = V - W^T U^{-1} W
$$

or

$$
S = U - W V^{-1} W^T
$$

Which of the two forms would you use to solve for the update $\Delta x_p$? State the reduced system that you would solve.

#### Derivation of the Schur Complement:
The system is:
$$
\begin{pmatrix} U & W \\ W^T & V \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \Delta x_p \\ \Delta x_i \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} b_p \\ b_i \end{pmatrix}
$$

To eliminate $\Delta x_i$ and solve for $\Delta x_p$, we use the Schur complement. Start with the first row:
$$
U \Delta x_p + W \Delta x_i = b_p
$$
Solve for $\Delta x_i$:
$$
W \Delta x_i = b_p - U \Delta x_p
$$
$$
\Delta x_i = W^{-1} (b_p - U \Delta x_p)
$$
(Assuming $W$ is invertible for now, though in practice, we adjust based on structure.)

Substitute into the second row:
$$
W^T \Delta x_p + V \Delta x_i = b_i
$$
$$
W^T \Delta x_p + V W^{-1} (b_p - U \Delta x_p) = b_i
$$
$$
W^T \Delta x_p + V W^{-1} b_p - V W^{-1} U \Delta x_p = b_i
$$
$$
(W^T - V W^{-1} U) \Delta x_p = b_i - V W^{-1} b_p
$$

This suggests a Schur complement, but let’s derive it correctly. Instead, eliminate $\Delta x_p$ using the second block. From the second row:
$$
V \Delta x_i + W^T \Delta x_p = b_i
$$
$$
\Delta x_i = V^{-1} (b_i - W^T \Delta x_p)
$$
Substitute into the first row:
$$
U \Delta x_p + W V^{-1} (b_i - W^T \Delta x_p) = b_p
$$
$$
U \Delta x_p + W V^{-1} b_i - W V^{-1} W^T \Delta x_p = b_p
$$
$$
(U - W V^{-1} W^T) \Delta x_p = b_p - W V^{-1} b_i
$$

The Schur complement $S = U - W V^{-1} W^T$ is consistent with this derivation.

#### Choice of Form:
- $S = V - W^T U^{-1} W$ is used when eliminating $\Delta x_p$ to solve for $\Delta x_i$.
- $S = U - W V^{-1} W^T$ is used when eliminating $\Delta x_i$ to solve for $\Delta x_p$.
- Since the question asks to solve for the update $\Delta x_p$, we use $S = U - W V^{-1} W^T$.

#### Reduced System:
The reduced system to solve for $\Delta x_p$ is:
$$
(U - W V^{-1} W^T) \Delta x_p = b_p - W V^{-1} b_i
$$

**Answer for 6.6:**
- I would use the form $S = U - W V^{-1} W^T$ to solve for $\Delta x_p$.
- The reduced system is $(U - W V^{-1} W^T) \Delta x_p = b_p - W V^{-1} b_i$.
