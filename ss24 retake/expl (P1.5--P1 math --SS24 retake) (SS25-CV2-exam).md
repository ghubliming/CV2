I’ll explain in detail how we calculate the dimensions of the Lie algebras $\mathfrak{so}(2)$ and $\mathfrak{se}(2)$, step by step, in a way that’s easy to follow. Since you asked for a detailed explanation, I’ll break it down thoroughly, including the math and intuition behind it. Let’s dive in!

### What Does "Dimension" Mean in This Context?
In mathematics, a Lie algebra is a set of matrices (or similar objects) that follow specific rules, like how they combine under addition and a special operation called the Lie bracket. The "dimension" of a Lie algebra is the number of independent parameters (or "degrees of freedom") needed to describe all the matrices in that set. Think of it like the number of knobs you can turn to create any possible matrix in the algebra—each knob is one dimension.

To find the dimension, we:
1. Identify the type of matrices in the Lie algebra.
2. Determine how many independent numbers (parameters) are needed to write any matrix in that set.
3. Count those parameters.

Now, let’s apply this to $\mathfrak{so}(2)$ and $\mathfrak{se}(2)$.

### Dimension of $\mathfrak{so}(2)$

#### Step 1: What is $\mathfrak{so}(2)$?
- $\mathfrak{so}(2)$ is the Lie algebra associated with the rotation group $SO(2)$, which describes all possible rotations of a 2D plane (like spinning a piece of paper).
- The Lie algebra $\mathfrak{so}(n)$ consists of $n \times n$ skew-symmetric matrices, meaning the transpose of the matrix equals its negative ($A^T = -A$), and the diagonal elements are zero.
- For $n = 2$, we’re dealing with 2×2 matrices.

#### Step 2: Write the General Form of a 2×2 Skew-Symmetric Matrix
- A 2×2 matrix has 4 entries:
  $$
  \begin{pmatrix}
  a & b \\
  c & d
  \end{pmatrix}
$$
- For it to be skew-symmetric:
  - The transpose $A^T$ is obtained by swapping rows and columns:
    $$
    A^T = \begin{pmatrix}
    a & c \\
    b & d
    \end{pmatrix}
$$
  - We need $A^T = -A$, so:
    $$
    \begin{pmatrix}
    a & c \\
    b & d
    \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
    -a & -b \\
    -c & -d
    \end{pmatrix}
$$
  - This gives us equations:
    - $a = -a$ → $a = 0$ (diagonal elements must be zero).
    - $d = -d$ → $d = 0$.
    - $c = -b$.
  - So, the matrix becomes:
    $$
    \begin{pmatrix}
    0 & b \\
    -b & 0
    \end{pmatrix}
$$
  - Here, $b$ is the only parameter we can change (it can be any real number, positive, negative, or zero).

#### Step 3: Count the Parameters
- The matrix depends on just one number, $b$. If we change $b$, we get a different matrix in $\mathfrak{so}(2)$.
- There are no other independent numbers to adjust, so the number of parameters is 1.

#### Step 4: Conclusion
- The dimension of $\mathfrak{so}(2)$ is 1, because we need only 1 parameter to describe all possible matrices in this Lie algebra.

#### Intuition
- $\mathfrak{so}(2)$ captures rotations, and in 2D, a rotation is fully determined by a single angle. The parameter $b$ relates to that angle, so 1 dimension makes sense.

### Dimension of $\mathfrak{se}(2)$

#### Step 1: What is $\mathfrak{se}(2)$?
- $\mathfrak{se}(2)$ is the Lie algebra of the Euclidean group $SE(2)$, which describes all combinations of rotations and translations in 2D space (e.g., rotating an object and then sliding it).
- The Lie algebra $\mathfrak{se}(n)$ includes matrices that represent both the rotation part (from $\mathfrak{so}(n)$) and the translation part. For 2D ($n = 2$), we use 3×3 matrices because we need to account for the 2D plane plus the algebra structure.

#### Step 2: Write the General Form of a Matrix in $\mathfrak{se}(2)$
- A general element of $\mathfrak{se}(2)$ is a 3×3 matrix that looks like this (in the context of the Lie algebra, using the standard representation):
  $$
  \begin{pmatrix}
  0 & -a & b \\
  a & 0 & c \\
  0 & 0 & 0
  \end{pmatrix}
$$
- Let’s break this down:
  - The top-left 2×2 block $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -a \\ a & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ is a skew-symmetric matrix, which handles the rotation part (similar to $\mathfrak{so}(2)$). The parameter $a$ controls the rotation.
  - The $b$ and $c$ in the last column represent translations in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively.
  - The bottom row is all zeros because this is a specific form that satisfies the Lie algebra conditions (it ensures the matrix acts correctly on 2D vectors extended with a 1).

#### Step 3: Count the Parameters
- We have three parameters:
  - $a$: Controls the rotation (how much the object spins).
  - $b$: Controls the translation along the $x$-axis (left or right).
  - $c$: Controls the translation along the $y$-axis (up or down).
- Each of these can be any real number, and changing one independently changes the matrix in a unique way.
- So, there are 3 independent parameters.

#### Step 4: Conclusion
- The dimension of $\mathfrak{se}(2)$ is 3, because we need 3 parameters to describe all possible matrices in this Lie algebra.

#### Intuition
- $\mathfrak{se}(2)$ combines rotation (1 degree of freedom, like $\mathfrak{so}(2)$) with translations in 2D (2 more degrees of freedom: $x$ and $y$). Together, that’s 1 + 2 = 3 dimensions, which matches our count.

### Final Answer
$$
\dim(\mathfrak{so}(2)) = 1
$$
$$
\dim(\mathfrak{se}(2)) = 3
$$

### Extra Notes
- The reason $\mathfrak{so}(2)$ uses 2×2 matrices and $\mathfrak{se}(2)$ uses 3×3 matrices is because of how Lie algebras are represented. $\mathfrak{so}(2)$ only needs the rotation part, while $\mathfrak{se}(2)$ needs to include translation, requiring a larger matrix to encode the full motion.
