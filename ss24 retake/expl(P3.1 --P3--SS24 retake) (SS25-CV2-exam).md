To find the inverse distortion function $f(r_d)$ such that $x = f(r_d) x_d$, where $x_d = g(r) x$ and $g(r) = \frac{k}{r} \arctan\left(\frac{r}{k}\right)$ with $r = |x|$ and $r_d = |x_d|$, we need to express $x$ in terms of $x_d$.

Given:
- $x_d = g(r) x$
- $g(r) = \frac{k}{r} \arctan\left(\frac{r}{k}\right)$
- $r = |x|$, $r_d = |x_d|$

First, the relationship between $r$ and $r_d$ comes from the magnitude of the vectors:
$$r_d = |x_d| = |g(r) x| = g(r) |x| = g(r) r$$
since $g(r)$ is a scalar and $|x| = r$. Substituting $g(r)$:
$$r_d = \left( \frac{k}{r} \arctan\left(\frac{r}{k}\right) \right) r = k \arctan\left(\frac{r}{k}\right)$$

Now, we need to solve for $r$ in terms of $r_d$:
$$r_d = k \arctan\left(\frac{r}{k}\right)$$
Let $\theta = \frac{r}{k}$, so $r = k \theta$ and $\arctan(\theta) = \frac{r_d}{k}$:
$$\theta = \tan\left(\frac{r_d}{k}\right)$$
$$r = k \tan\left(\frac{r_d}{k}\right)$$

The inverse function $f(r_d)$ should undo the distortion, so the magnitude relationship suggests:
$$|x| = f(r_d) |x_d|$$
Since $r = |x|$ and $r_d = |x_d|$, and the distortion scales the vector $x$ by $g(r)$, the inverse scaling factor $f(r_d)$ should be the reciprocal of $g(r)$ evaluated at the original $r$, but expressed in terms of $r_d$. Given $r = k \tan\left(\frac{r_d}{k}\right)$, we substitute into $g(r)$:
$$g(r) = \frac{k}{r} \arctan\left(\frac{r}{k}\right)$$
However, we need $f(r_d)$ such that $x = f(r_d) x_d$. Since $x_d = g(r) x$, the inverse is:
$$x = \frac{1}{g(r)} x_d$$
We need $g(r)$ in terms of $r_d$. From $r_d = k \arctan\left(\frac{r}{k}\right)$, we have $\frac{r}{k} = \tan\left(\frac{r_d}{k}\right)$, so:
$$\arctan\left(\frac{r}{k}\right) = \frac{r_d}{k}$$
$$g(r) = \frac{k}{r} \cdot \frac{r_d}{k} = \frac{r_d}{r}$$
But $r = k \tan\left(\frac{r_d}{k}\right)$, so:
$$g(r) = \frac{r_d}{k \tan\left(\frac{r_d}{k}\right)}$$

Thus, the inverse function is:
$$f(r_d) = \frac{1}{g(r)} = \frac{k \tan\left(\frac{r_d}{k}\right)}{r_d}$$

So, the inverse distortion function is:
$$f(r_d) = \frac{k \tan\left(\frac{r_d}{k}\right)}{r_d}$$
