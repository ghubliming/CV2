# Linear Algebra Problem Analysis - SO(3) and Matrix Spaces

## Problem Statement

Determine which statement is correct regarding special orthogonal groups, symmetric matrices, and Lie algebras.

## Mathematical Definitions

### Key Spaces and Groups

- **$\text{sym}(3)$**: Space of $3 \times 3$ symmetric matrices where $A = A^T$
- **$SO(3)$**: Special orthogonal group of $3 \times 3$ matrices where $AA^T = I$ and $\det(A) = 1$
- **$\text{se}(3)$**: Lie algebra of $SE(3)$, consisting of $4 \times 4$ matrices of the form: $$\begin{pmatrix} \hat{\omega} & v \ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$ where $\hat{\omega}$ is skew-symmetric and $v \in \mathbb{R}^3$

## Analysis of Each Option

### Option 1: sym(3) as Subvectorspace with Matrix Multiplication

**Statement**: $\text{sym}(3) = {A \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3} | A = A^T}$ is a subvectorspace of $\mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}$ over $\mathbb{R}$ with matrix multiplication.

**Result**: ❌ **INCORRECT**

**Reasoning**:

- Vector spaces require addition and scalar multiplication, not matrix multiplication
- $\text{sym}(3)$ IS a subvectorspace of $\mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}$, but with matrix addition and scalar multiplication
- Matrix multiplication doesn't preserve the vector space structure

### Option 2: SO(3) as Subvectorspace

**Statement**: $SO(3) \subset \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}$ is a subvectorspace of $\mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}$ vectorspace over $\mathbb{R}$ with matrix addition.

**Result**: ❌ **INCORRECT**

**Reasoning**:

- $SO(3)$ is NOT a subvectorspace because:
    - Zero matrix $\notin SO(3)$ (since $\det(0) = 0 \neq 1$)
    - Not closed under addition: $A, B \in SO(3)$ doesn't imply $A + B \in SO(3)$
    - Not closed under scalar multiplication: $A \in SO(3)$ doesn't imply $cA \in SO(3)$ for $c \neq 0, 1$

### Option 3: SO(3) as Subgroup of ℝ³ˣ³

**Statement**: $SO(3)$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}$ with matrix multiplication.

**Result**: ❌ **INCORRECT**

**Reasoning**:

- $\mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}$ is NOT a group under matrix multiplication
- For group structure, every element needs an inverse
- Singular matrices (with $\det = 0$) have no multiplicative inverse
- Cannot have a subgroup of something that isn't a group

**Correct statement**: $SO(3)$ is a subgroup of $GL(3, \mathbb{R})$ (General Linear Group)

### Option 4: SO(3) as Subgroup of ℝ³

**Statement**: $SO(3)$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{R}^3$ with matrix multiplication.

**Result**: ❌ **INCORRECT**

**Reasoning**:

- **Fundamental type mismatch**:
    - $SO(3)$ contains $3 \times 3$ matrices
    - $\mathbb{R}^3$ contains 3-dimensional vectors
    - Cannot have matrices as subset of vectors

### Option 5: se(3) as Group and Vector Space

**Statement**: $\text{se}(3)$ is a group with matrix addition and a vectorspace over $\mathbb{R}$ with matrix addition.

**Result**: ✅ **CORRECT** (with caveat)

**Reasoning**:

- **As vector space**: $\text{se}(3)$ IS a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ with matrix addition and scalar multiplication
- **As group**: $\text{se}(3)$ DOES form an abelian group under matrix addition:
    - Closure: Sum of two $\text{se}(3)$ elements is in $\text{se}(3)$
    - Associativity: Matrix addition is associative
    - Identity: Zero matrix is in $\text{se}(3)$
    - Inverses: Negative of any $\text{se}(3)$ element is in $\text{se}(3)$

**Caveat**: While mathematically correct, the terminology "se(3) is a group" is non-standard. Lie algebras are typically not called "groups" even when they satisfy group axioms under addition.

## Final Answer

**Option 5 is correct**.

Despite the non-standard terminology, it's the only option that's mathematically sound. The $\text{se}(3)$ Lie algebra does satisfy both properties mentioned, while all other options contain fundamental mathematical errors.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Vector spaces** require addition and scalar multiplication, not matrix multiplication
2. **$SO(3)$** is a Lie group, not a vector space
3. **$\mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$** is not a group under matrix multiplication due to singular matrices
4. **Type consistency** matters: matrices vs. vectors are different mathematical objects
5. **Lie algebras** are vector spaces that also form abelian groups under addition
6.
