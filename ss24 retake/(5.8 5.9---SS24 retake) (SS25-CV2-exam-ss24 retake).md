# 3D Rigid Body Motion Analysis

## Problem Statement

Computing 3D rigid body motion (with unknown scale) between two images of the same static scene, given different constraints on camera calibration and translation.

## Mathematical Framework

### 3D Rigid Body Motion Parameters

A 3D rigid body motion between two camera poses can be described by:
- **Rotation matrix**: $R \in SO(3)$ (3×3 orthogonal matrix)
- **Translation vector**: $t \in \mathbb{R}^3$

The rotation matrix $R$ has **3 degrees of freedom** (can be parameterized by 3 angles).
The translation vector $t$ has **3 degrees of freedom**.

### Point Correspondence Constraint

For a 3D point $X$ observed in two images at pixel coordinates $(u_1, v_1)$ and $(u_2, v_2)$, the **epipolar constraint** is:

$$\begin{bmatrix} u_2 & v_2 & 1 \end{bmatrix} E \begin{bmatrix} u_1 \\ v_1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = 0$$

where $E$ is the **essential matrix**: $E = [t]_\times R$

Here $[t]_\times$ is the skew-symmetric matrix of $t$:
$$[t]_\times = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -t_z & t_y \\ t_z & 0 & -t_x \\ -t_y & t_x & 0 \end{bmatrix}$$

Each point correspondence provides **1 constraint equation**.

## Scenario 5.8: Known Intrinsic Camera Calibration

### Unknowns
- Rotation matrix $R$: **3 degrees of freedom**
- Translation vector $t$: **3 degrees of freedom**
- **Scale factor**: Since we have "unknown scale", we can normalize $||t|| = 1$, reducing translation to **2 degrees of freedom**

**Total unknowns: 3 + 2 = 5**

### Constraints
Each point correspondence provides **1 epipolar constraint**.

**Number of constraints: $n$ (where $n$ is the number of point correspondences)**

### Minimum Point Correspondences
For a solvable system: $\text{constraints} \geq \text{unknowns}$

$$n \geq 5$$

**Minimum number of point correspondences needed: 5**

This is the famous **5-point algorithm** for essential matrix estimation.

## Scenario 5.9: Known Calibration + No Translation

### Additional Constraint
The constraint "no translation between the two images" means $t = 0$.

### Unknowns
- Rotation matrix $R$: **3 degrees of freedom**
- Translation vector $t = 0$: **0 degrees of freedom**

**Total unknowns: 3**

### Constraints
Each point correspondence still provides **1 epipolar constraint**.

However, with $t = 0$, the essential matrix becomes $E = [0]_\times R = 0$.

The epipolar constraint becomes degenerate, but we can use the **homography constraint** instead:

$$\begin{bmatrix} u_2 \\ v_2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \sim H \begin{bmatrix} u_1 \\ v_1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$

where $H = K R K^{-1}$ and $K$ is the known camera intrinsic matrix.

Since $K$ is known, we have $R = K^{-1} H K$.

The homography $H$ is a 3×3 matrix with 8 degrees of freedom (defined up to scale), but since we're solving for $R$ (3 DOF), we effectively have **3 degrees of freedom**.

**Number of constraints: $n$ (each point correspondence provides 1 constraint)**

### Minimum Point Correspondences
For a solvable system: $\text{constraints} \geq \text{unknowns}$

$$n \geq 3$$

**Minimum number of point correspondences needed: 3**

## Summary

| Scenario                                | Unknowns | Constraints per Point | Min. Point Correspondences |
| --------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 5.8: Known calibration                  | 5        | 1                     | 5                          |
| 5.9: Known calibration + no translation | 3        | 1                     | 3                          |

### Key Insights

1. **Scenario 5.8** requires the classic 5-point algorithm for essential matrix estimation
2. **Scenario 5.9** reduces to a pure rotation problem, solvable with homography estimation
3. The "unknown scale" constraint in 5.8 reduces the translation DOF from 3 to 2
4. The "no translation" constraint in 5.9 eliminates translation DOF entirely

### Mathematical Derivation Notes

The inequality $\text{constraints} \geq \text{unknowns}$ ensures the system is not underdetermined. In practice:
- Exactly meeting this minimum often leads to multiple solutions
- Using more point correspondences than the minimum provides robustness and unique solutions
- RANSAC or other robust estimation methods are typically used with these minimal solutions
