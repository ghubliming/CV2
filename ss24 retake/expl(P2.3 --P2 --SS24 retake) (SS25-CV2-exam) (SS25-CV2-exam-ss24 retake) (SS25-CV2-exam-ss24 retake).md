# Task 2.3: Detailed Explanation

## The Problem

The task is to fill in the missing term in the following equation, based on the provided context of Taylor series expansions for sinusoidal functions.

$$
\cos(t) = 1 - \boxed{?}
$$

## Step-by-Step Solution

1.  **Recall the Taylor Series for $\cos(t)$:**
    The problem provides the Taylor series expansion for the cosine function around $t=0$ (also known as the Maclaurin series):
    $$
    \cos(t) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n t^{2n}}{(2n)!}
    $$

2.  **Expand the Series:**
    Let's write out the first few terms of the series to understand its structure:
    -   For $n=0$: $\frac{(-1)^0 t^{2(0)}}{(2 \cdot 0)!} = \frac{1 \cdot t^0}{0!} = \frac{1}{1} = 1$
    -   For $n=1$: $\frac{(-1)^1 t^{2(1)}}{(2 \cdot 1)!} = \frac{-1 \cdot t^2}{2!} = -\frac{t^2}{2}$
    -   For $n=2$: $\frac{(-1)^2 t^{2(2)}}{(2 \cdot 2)!} = \frac{1 \cdot t^4}{4!} = \frac{t^4}{24}$
    -   For $n=3$: $\frac{(-1)^3 t^{2(3)}}{(2 \cdot 3)!} = \frac{-1 \cdot t^6}{6!} = -\frac{t^6}{720}$

    So, the full expansion is an infinite sum:
    $$
    \cos(t) = 1 - \frac{t^2}{2!} + \frac{t^4}{4!} - \frac{t^6}{6!} + \dots
    $$

3.  **Isolate the Missing Term:**
    The equation given is $\cos(t) = 1 - \boxed{?}$. Let's denote the missing term by $X$.
    $$
    \cos(t) = 1 - X
    $$
    To find what $X$ is, we can rearrange the equation:
    $$
    X = 1 - \cos(t)
    $$

4.  **Substitute the Series Expansion:**
    Now, we substitute the Taylor series expansion of $\cos(t)$ into our equation for $X$:
    $$
    X = 1 - \left( 1 - \frac{t^2}{2!} + \frac{t^4}{4!} - \frac{t^6}{6!} + \dots \right)
    $$

5.  **Simplify the Expression:**
    By distributing the negative sign across the terms in the parenthesis, we can simplify the expression:
    $$
    X = 1 - 1 + \frac{t^2}{2!} - \frac{t^4}{4!} + \frac{t^6}{6!} - \dots
    $$
    The leading '1's cancel out, leaving:
    $$
    X = \frac{t^2}{2!} - \frac{t^4}{4!} + \frac{t^6}{6!} - \dots
    $$

6.  **Express as a Summation:**
    The resulting series is the missing term. We can write this back in a compact summation form. This series is very similar to the original $\cos(t)$ series, but it starts from $n=1$ and the signs of the terms are inverted.
    $$
    X = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n-1} t^{2n}}{(2n)!}
    $$
    This is the complete and formal answer for the term in the box.

    Therefore, the filled equation is:
    $$
    \cos(t) = 1 - \left( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n-1} t^{2n}}{(2n)!} \right)
    $$

## General Method Used

The method used to solve this problem is the **Taylor Series Expansion**. A Taylor series is a way to represent a function as an infinite sum of terms. These terms are calculated from the function's derivatives at a single point. For a function $f(x)$ that is infinitely differentiable at a point $a$, its Taylor series is given by the formula:
$$
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} (x-a)^n
$$
When the expansion is centered at $a=0$, it is called a **Maclaurin series**. The series for $\sin(t)$ and $\cos(t)$ provided in the problem are Maclaurin series. This technique is a cornerstone of calculus and analysis, widely used in physics and engineering to approximate complex functions with simpler polynomial functions.

## Related Concepts and Background Knowledge

### Taylor Series
-   **Purpose:** The primary purpose of a Taylor series is to approximate functions. Polynomials are computationally simple; they are easy to evaluate, differentiate, and integrate. By representing a more complex function like $\cos(t)$ as a polynomial series, we can work with it more effectively.
-   **Convergence:** A Taylor series accurately represents the function only within its *radius of convergence*. For $\sin(t)$ and $\cos(t)$, the series converge for all real numbers $t$, meaning the approximation can be made arbitrarily accurate by including more terms.

### Cosine Function ($\cos(t)$)
-   **Geometric Definition:** In trigonometry, the cosine of an angle in a right-angled triangle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse. On a unit circle, $\cos(t)$ is the x-coordinate of the point on the circle corresponding to the angle $t$.
-   **Key Properties:**
    -   **Periodicity:** The cosine function is periodic with a period of $2\pi$, so $\cos(t) = \cos(t + 2\pi)$.
    -   **Even Function:** Cosine is an even function, meaning $\cos(-t) = \cos(t)$. This is reflected in its Taylor series, which only contains even powers of $t$.
    -   **Derivative:** The derivative of cosine is negative sine: $\frac{d}{dt}\cos(t) = -\sin(t)$. The derivatives of sine and cosine are cyclical, which is why their Taylor series are so closely related.

### Factorials ($n!$)
-   The factorial of a non-negative integer $n$, written as $n!$, is the product of all positive integers up to $n$ (e.g., $4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24$).
-   By convention, $0! = 1$. This definition is crucial for many mathematical formulas, including the Taylor series for $n=0$, to hold true.
