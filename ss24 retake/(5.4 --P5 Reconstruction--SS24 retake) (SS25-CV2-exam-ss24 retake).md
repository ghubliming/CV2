## 5.4 Uniqueness of Relative Camera Pose

### Problem Statement

We now consider candidate absolute poses $(\hat{R}_i, \hat{T}_i)_{i=1,2}$ instead of true poses $(R_i, T_i)_{i=1,2}$. The question is whether the true relative camera pose $(R, T)$ is the **only** one that satisfies the property $\mathcal{P}$: "there exists a valid pixel $p$."

Property $\mathcal{P}$ means that for a pixel $p$ in the first image plane, we have $\hat{\tau}(p, z) = \tau(p, z)$ for some depth $z$ (i.e., the reprojections match using the candidate relative pose).

### Analysis

**Answer: No, the true relative camera pose is NOT the only one that satisfies property $\mathcal{P}$.**

### Why This Is the Case

The fundamental reason is that the epipolar constraint provides only **one equation per point correspondence**, but we're trying to determine **6 degrees of freedom** (3 for rotation, 3 for translation) for the relative pose.

For a single pixel $p$:
1. The epipolar constraint gives us: $\hat{\tau}(p, z)^T F p = 0$
2. This is **one scalar equation**
3. But the relative pose $(R, T)$ has **6 degrees of freedom**

**Mathematical explanation:**
- The fundamental matrix $F$ depends on the relative pose $(R, T)$
- For any given pixel $p$, the constraint $\hat{\tau}(p, z) = \tau(p, z)$ defines a **curve in the 6D pose space**
- This curve is not a single point, so multiple poses can satisfy the constraint

### Constructing Alternative Candidate Poses

To construct candidate absolute poses $(\hat{R}_i, \hat{T}_i)_{i=1,2}$ whose relative pose $(\hat{R}, \hat{T})$ satisfies property $\mathcal{P}$ but differs from $(R, T)$:

**Method 1: Epipolar Geometry Ambiguity**

Given the fundamental matrix $F$ from the true relative pose, there are **four possible relative poses** that generate the same fundamental matrix:
1. $(R, T)$ - the true pose
2. $(R, -T)$ - negated translation
3. $(R^T, -R^T T)$ - swapped cameras with adjusted translation
4. $(R^T, R^T T)$ - swapped cameras with opposite translation

**Construction:**
$\hat{R}_1 = R_1, \quad \hat{T}_1 = T_1$
$\hat{R}_2 = R_1 R^T, \quad \hat{T}_2 = T_1 - R_1 R^T T$

where the relative pose becomes $(\hat{R}, \hat{T}) = (R^T, -R^T T)$.

**Method 2: Scale Ambiguity**

For any non-zero scalar $s \neq 0$:
$\hat{R}_1 = R_1, \quad \hat{T}_1 = T_1$
$\hat{R}_2 = R_2, \quad \hat{T}_2 = s \cdot T_2 + (1-s) \cdot R_2 R_1^T T_1$

This gives a relative pose with scaled translation that still satisfies the epipolar constraint for specific pixel correspondences.

**Method 3: Systematic Construction**

1. Choose any pixel $p$ in the first image
2. Choose a depth $z$ and compute the true reprojection $\tau(p, z)$
3. The constraint $\hat{\tau}(p, z) = \tau(p, z)$ defines a 5-dimensional manifold in the 6D pose space
4. Pick any other point $(\hat{R}, \hat{T})$ on this manifold
5. Construct candidate absolute poses that realize this relative pose

### Key Insight

The **scale ambiguity** in structure from motion is fundamental: if we scale the entire 3D scene and camera translations by the same factor, all pixel correspondences remain valid. This means infinitely many relative poses can satisfy property $\mathcal{P}$ for any given pixel.

**Conclusion:** Multiple relative poses can satisfy property $\mathcal{P}$, which is why additional constraints (like multiple point correspondences, known scale, or prior information) are needed to uniquely determine camera poses in practice.
