# Task 6.4: 8-Point Algorithm vs. Bundle Adjustment

## Correct Statement
The correct statement is:
**The 8-point algorithm does not allow for estimating the camera intrinsics, while bundle adjustment does.**

---

## Detailed Explanation

Here is a breakdown of why this statement is correct and the others are not, based on the principles of Structure from Motion (SfM) and 3D reconstruction.

### The 8-Point Algorithm
- **Purpose**: The primary role of the 8-point algorithm is to calculate the **Essential Matrix (E)** or the **Fundamental Matrix (F)** from a set of at least eight corresponding points between two images.
- **Function**: It solves a system of linear equations based on the coplanarity constraint. The equation for the Fundamental matrix is $x'^{T}Fx = 0$, where $x$ and $x'$ are corresponding points in homogeneous coordinates.
- **Output**: The result is the F or E matrix, from which the relative rotation (R) and translation (t) between the two camera views can be extracted.
- **Intrinsics**: The standard 8-point algorithm assumes **calibrated cameras** (known intrinsics) to find the Essential Matrix. If the cameras are uncalibrated, it finds the Fundamental Matrix, which has the intrinsics baked into it ($E = K'^{T}FK$). However, the algorithm itself **does not solve for the intrinsic parameters** (like focal length $f$, principal point $c_x, c_y$). It treats them as either known or as an inseparable part of the Fundamental Matrix.
- **Speed**: It is a **linear and computationally fast** algorithm.

### Bundle Adjustment (BA)
- **Purpose**: Bundle Adjustment is a comprehensive **non-linear optimization** process. It is almost always the final and most critical step in any high-accuracy 3D reconstruction pipeline.
- **Function**: BA simultaneously refines a wide range of parameters to minimize the overall **reprojection error**. The reprojection error is the difference between the observed 2D image points and the 2D points projected from the estimated 3D model.
- **Parameters Optimized**:
    1.  **3D Structure**: The coordinates of the 3D points in the scene ($X_i$).
    2.  **Camera Parameters (Extrinsics)**: The rotation (R) and translation (T) of all cameras.
    3.  **Camera Parameters (Intrinsics)**: The focal length, principal point, and lens distortion coefficients for each camera (if they are not fixed).
- **Initialization**: Because it is a non-linear, iterative process, BA is prone to local minima. It requires a **good initial guess** for all parameters, which is often provided by simpler, linear methods like the 8-point algorithm.
- **Robustness**: When properly initialized, BA is highly **robust to noise** and produces the most accurate, geometrically consistent 3D reconstruction possible.

## Analysis of the Options

1.  **The 8-point algorithm is in general a bit slower than bundle adjustment.**
    - **False**. The 8-point algorithm is significantly **faster** because it is a direct linear method, while BA is a large-scale, iterative optimization problem.

2.  **The 8-point algorithm does not allow for estimating the camera intrinsics, while bundle adjustment does.**
    - **True**. This is the core difference. The 8-point algorithm computes the epipolar geometry (R, t) but does not solve for the intrinsic parameters of the camera model. BA is explicitly designed to refine intrinsics alongside all other parameters.

3.  **The 8-point algorithm depends on the pose initialization and is more efficient than bundle adjustment.**
    - **False**. The 8-point algorithm *provides* the initial pose; it doesn't depend on one. Bundle adjustment is the method that depends on this initialization.

4.  **Bundle adjustment is more sensitive to noise, while the 8-point algorithm is more robust and can handle noise and outliers better.**
    - **False**. This is the opposite of the truth. The basic 8-point algorithm is very sensitive to noise. Bundle adjustment, by minimizing a geometric cost function over all views and points, is far more robust and effective at reducing the impact of noise.

5.  **The 8-point algorithm is more robust to noise and outliers than bundle adjustment, given a good initialization.**
    - **False**. Even with a good initialization, BA's goal is to find the optimal solution that best fits all the data, making it inherently more robust to noise than the 8-point algorithm's algebraic solution.
