The correct statement is: "The 8-point algorithm depends on the pose initialization and is more efficient than bundle adjustment."

### Explanation:
- The 8-point algorithm is a method used in computer vision to estimate the fundamental matrix from point correspondences, requiring an initial pose estimate. It is generally more efficient than bundle adjustment because it involves a linear solution followed by a simple nonlinear refinement, whereas bundle adjustment is an iterative nonlinear optimization that adjusts all parameters (3D points, camera poses, and intrinsics) simultaneously, making it computationally more intensive.
- The other statements are incorrect:
  - "The 8-point algorithm is in general a bit slower than bundle adjustment" is false, as the 8-point algorithm is typically faster.
  - "The 8-point algorithm does not allow for estimating the camera intrinsics, while bundle adjustment does" is false, as the 8-point algorithm can be extended to handle intrinsics (e.g., with the normalized 8-point algorithm), and bundle adjustment can also estimate them.
  - "Bundle adjustment is more sensitive to noise, while the 8-point algorithm is more robust and can handle noise and outliers better" is false; bundle adjustment is generally more robust to noise when properly initialized, while the 8-point algorithm can be sensitive to noise and outliers unless combined with robust techniques like RANSAC.
  - "The 8-point algorithm is more robust to noise and outliers than bundle adjustment, given a good initialization" is false; with good initialization, bundle adjustment typically outperforms the 8-point algorithm in robustness due to its global optimization nature.
